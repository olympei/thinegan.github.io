## Binary.com

I worked on Binary.com, a provider of fixed-odd financial contracts, as an employee of Regent Markets (the siteâ€™s owner) for seven years.
The service has a large user base, and I worked to maintaining the system and bring it forward.

I learned a lot about the dynamics of a system engineering during my time there, from how to have the discipline to writing quality perl code, to the difficulties of managing and keeping over 50 servers secure all around the world.

Definitely my pragmatism, attitude toward Getting Things Done.

Tech stack:
Perl, Bash, CouchDB, PCI, OpenVZ, Apache2_Modperl, Nginx_SSL_Proxy, AWS, OpenVPN, Scrum, Samange, Jira, Git, Debian, Centos
